# News list

Test Flutter project

This project is created to demonstrate a list of news retrieved from [open API](https://newsapi.org) 
with the api key.

We can read the details of each article on a new screen by clicking on the list item.


Please note: You should use your own API key for this open API to avoid storing key in version control.
To do that, please create a file named ".env" in the project's root directory (where the pubspec.yaml is located).
Then add Your API Key to the .env File: API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
